### User Findings(09/29/17)

##### DAY: Sep 29th
##### PLACE: Hebrew Home at Riverdale
##### TALKED TO: David Finkelstein (Chief Information Officer)
##### MAIN REMARKS:
- Hebrew Home was already looking for a integrated “Smart Home” system over the past year.
- They approached several companies, including Samsung, but no one was able to provide the integrated platform as a service accompanied with the data collection that they need.
- Their institution provides several different services:
  - Short term rehabilitation of patients after an array of hospital procedures/ health conditions.
  - Care for dementia pecients
  - Enriched live care
  - Care for elderly individuals with special diseases.
  - Assisted Living.
  - Independent Living.
- The best implementation of Smart Products that they see is particularly focused on the Independent Living sector, which has less restrictions due to regulations in place (non-medical care) and for the same reason is more suptable to health sitution occuring.
- They focus on 2 main Smart Home features:
  - Safety/Security
    - Pad to detect # time out of bed
    - Pad to monitor vitals such as breathing and heart-rate when in bed.
    - Amenities access (refrigerator, outdoor activities)
    - Ability to request assistance both non-emergency and emergency within the home.
  - Clinical
    - Blood pressure data
    - Pill box access logs
    - Oxygen levels data
    - An array of health data gathering devices.
- They need a service that could collect the data from the devices, eventually analyse the results and indicate what actions must be done in case by case.
- Most of the devices already exist, but manufacturing companies do not engage on analyzing data and providing insight for them.
- The “data center” analyzing companies do not provide the sensor network
- As a prediction of the future, they believe in Telemedicine, where doctors could evaluate patients remotely, issues persist in how to charge for services in urban areas - rural areas are already implementing it in some sort of degree.

### User Findings(10/11/17)

##### DAY: Oct 11th
##### PLACE: Weill Cornell
##### TALKED TO: Dr. Mack S. Lachs
##### MAIN REMARKS:
 
- Strongly supports the idea and its application within nursing homes (independent living)
- “Physical aids (assistants) are better in predicting patient sickness compared to doctors”
- Elders prefer no human assistants as it costs and its embarrassing
- Know that the process of getting sick is different in elders compared to youngsters/adults
- Most startups that deal with this field fail because they think they know what the elders need (e.g. ideas like Skype, 100 mile track etc.). They’ve even experimented with XBOX motion detection.
- Basic activity and movements (young and adults often take for granted) are key factors that are indicative of looming sickness or death.
- Activity includes: frequency of movements, time to get to point A to B (could be corridor), bed mobility, morning setup, eating duration, transferability. For example, change in walking speeds can be indicative of death
  - preventing bed sores, also a tech that’s currently implemented in Hebrew home   
  - greeting, brushing teeth, face wash etc.  
  - ability to move from the bed to the chair and vice versa, is it completed independently or does it require 1 or 2 people?
- Based off the preliminary TMP (timed manual performance) test that tests manual performance as a predictor of death in the elderly community. It was found our that the slower it took the elders to complete the test, the higher the death rate.
- Common sickness predicted are: pneumonia and UTI
- In terms of frequency threshold (when to alert), it depends on each individual elder, anything that deviates from the norm
- With a huge quantity of elders, the system would benefit nursing homes as there is only that much attention given at a certain period
It also would benefit insurance, banks, providers, nursing homes, families
  - Insurance: a more accurate package plan  
  - Bank: provides more accurate prediction for reverse mortgage: you pay the elders that are expected to die so you can own their property 
  - Providers: saving on hospitalization costs  
  - Nursing Homes: better facility and service  
  - Families: Safety & Security  
- We were told to refer to “Care at Hand” service where they used Dr. Lachs research paper determining highly predictive factors for looming sickness in adults.
- He doubts the capability of Samsung’s devices in terms of sensitivity and quality of data. Would prefer a more tailored activity monitoring system like Fitbit technologies.
- Got in contact with Janey Peterson, who is a PhD student in nursing that is interested in actigraphy and has existing data we can work off from
- Dr. Lachs didn't focus on what he wants to see (insights or anything along that line) as a doctor, rather he wishes that the system would prevent hospitalization or sickness manifestation in the first place

### User Findings(10/20/17)

##### DAY: Oct 20th
##### PLACE: Roosevelt Island Senior Center
##### TALKED TO: Yulisa, Sid, and an old lady
##### MAIN REMARKS:
 
Yulisa:
- Yulisa is the case worker at Senior Center, she helps seniors in applying for government benefit programs, addressing landlord/tenant disputes, and accessing medical care.
- Yulisa understands our product demo and thinks seniors welcome new technologies.
- Yulisa asks if there's an emergency button for immediate help and call to actions. We can incorporate personal emergency alert system in our smart home technology kit in the future.
- Fall detection is an important measurement for the elderly.

Sid:
- Sid is the staff at Senior Center. He likes the idea of working with Nursing Homes beacuse he noticed seniors are concerned about their privacy. Seniors might feel like being watched even we don't use cameras.
- From his experience interacting with seniors, Sid learned that seniors like to talk to each other. Sid suggests that we should have written scripts with clear instruction when explaining to seniors about how smart home devices work and make sure to tell seniors the exact same thing.
- Seniors would like to know how they are doing once smart home devices are installed. We may think of building an end-user interface for the elderly in the future
- There are many companies coming to Senior Center to give health and wellness workshops. Some seniors regualarly go to these sessions while some don't care. In general, women are more concerned with their health than men

Old Lady:
- She thought we were trying to sell her the product and stated she's not going to pay for smart home devices. She said that her sister got something similar (home monitoring system) from the healthcare provider for free. This justifies our analysis on price barrier and B2B strategy.
- She has a daily rountine. She turns on TV after waking up every morning for weather forecasts. While she's at home, she spends lots of time watching TV on her sofa during the day. She also likes to go out and play board games with her girlfriends.
- She likes playing games because she thinks it is important to exercise cognitive function for older people.
- She doesn't think she need anything to monitor her health and well-being because she thinks she knows about herself well.

##### DAY: Oct 21st
##### TALKED TO: Jeff
##### MAIN REMARKS:
- Jeff is a software engineer with some background in machine learning.
- He likes the mockup for the UI and thinks that it has the potential to be a practical monitoring and data visualization tool for nursing home.
- An ability to pull and publish monitoring logs will definitely be helpful so the collected data can be further analyzed by the patient's doctor.
- Nurses and doctors should have an easy way to set default as well as individual threshold values for alerts.
- A seamless integration with the database of patients' medical records would be a plus.
- Privacy of patients is of utmost importance.


### User Findings (10/20/17)

##### DAY: Oct 20th
##### TALKED TO: Arber
##### MAIN REMARKS:

- Arber is working for the NSF.  His background is in Business Development, Entrepreneurship and Startups.
- He feels that our approach is unique when it comes to answering our HMW and that the nursing homes along with the assisted/independent living home market will benefit from smarthome devices.  
-  He thought that adding a couple of different devices to show tech growth potential would be nice, and liked the data visualization on our UI.
- Was able to understand the UI and product specs and  felt that the prototype would be worthwhile in order to present a more compact view of the product idea.
- He loved the fact that the customer response was positive (Hebrew Home), but he encouraged us to talk with more facilities.
- He sees a growth potential both as a business and a product specifically in the next evolution of the product there is a way to connect with medical systems in order to push information they would require for patient’s medical diagnosis, as well as help in the research medical schools perform.
- Feels that exposing businesses, other than manufacturing, to the world of IoT utilizing current market lineups and especially smarthome devices will help the market grow more rapidly and increase adoption: “It is inevitable that smarthomes and IoT will be integral part of life in the future, but due to the price point and not an array of clear benefits at the moment will propel the market to grow in different verticals before it reaches critical mass. It is the right track”

### User Findings (11/14/17)

##### DAY: Nov 14th
##### TALKED TO: Maria Bravo
##### MAIN REMARKS:

- She works in recreational in Coler Nursing Home
- 750 beds in the facility
- Most nurses deal with checklist-type forms
- These primary use of these forms are to assess performances of recreational activities (although we have yet to actually see the forms for ourselves)
- Nursing Administration number: 2128486150/6160

### User Findings (11/15/17)

##### DAY: Nov 15th
##### TALKED TO: Sakkari Devray, Assitant Director of Nursing Department
##### MAIN REMARKS:

- The Long time nursing care has three types of units: Independent Units, Heavy Dependent Units and Rehab Units.
  - Independent untis have 3 units intotal, 27 patients/unit.
-	Each nurse is assigned to specific unit. For each unit, there are three nurse: 1 in charge of meditation, 1 in charge of treatment, 1 unit manager.
- Currently, nurses don’t measure a lot of things. In most cases, nurse observe and watch how well patients have been. Instead of measuring exact values, nurses assess independence and record how many times the elderly needs assistance in a day. Other things they oversee/measure are:
  - Sleeping: hours of sleep, sleep-wake patterns
  - Transferring: # of steps during da time, # of time they need assistance, how well is the balance
  - Eating: how much they finish in one single meal (measured in percentage)
- They have a system that nurses type in doctor notes and daily report by the end of the day. Documentation of each patient is in paper form.
