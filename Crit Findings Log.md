### Summarized feedback from Crit Group

• The transition from Smart Home into nursing homes still isn't clear presentation-wise

• Focus on one aspect and do it well (e.g. strongly focusing on the sensor that detects bathroom visit count)

• Since we have one nursing home that:
1) is interested in what we're building and;
2) expressed their need in it, then focus on them. Get them to contribute if they can throughout development

### Summarized feedback from Greg Pass

• Considering the broadness of “Smart Homes”, it is necessary to pick a particular subset of products and possible users.

• The choice of product (sensor kit to monitor behavior + platform to combine data) and user segment (nursing homes) seems to be right, addressing a mapped need.

• Risk: only one possible client was addressed. More research is required

• Next steps:
  1)	Reach for more nursing homes to confirm demand
  2)	Reach for doctors to confirm technical/clinical relevance of information
  3)	Reach for possible final clients to evaluate possible aversion to data collection

### Summarized feedback from Product Studio Alumni

### Style
Too much text. You will lose more and more of your audience the more text you use. It feels visually monotone. It's better to just use captivating visuals and your voice. If you have to use text on a slide, keep it to one sentence - or key words - that you are really trying to drive home. 

Remember - make the audience care about the problem, convince me of your epiphany/wedge and then convince me how every part of your solution solves the problem. 

Your wedge about why you chose retirement homes was weak(it's a place where people are concerned about safety and security - a benefit of smart homes) You didn't convince me that it would solve the question you are answering. 

Your demo was very confusing. You showed an interface and then a video and they didn't seem connected. You didn't fully convince me that your solution solved the problem -- not the question you were given, or the question you invented (How might we make nursing homes more safe and secure with smart home technology?) You just showed us what would happen but didn't talk about the benefits...aka why this is better than existing processes. 


### Your Idea
Your solution doesn't answer the question. "How might we increase customer's understanding of how to use and take advantage of the smart home?"

It doesn't help the general public understand smart homes better...as most people have never been to a retirement home. And the needs of people in retirement homes are different from those of normal people. Aka, as a young healthy woman, I'm not worried about detecting an impending illness or a fall. Your solution doesn't help the average person understand how smart homes will help them.

The tricky part here is that you have to do this through a product. It could be a remote that connects all smart devices and helps them work together in helpful ways. For example, your baby's crib might send you an alert telling you that you're baby is awake and then your product would suggest that you make the smart lights blue and play soothing music (as it has been proven to help babies asleep the fastest). These suggestions would be based on psychology at first...but then would be informed by data collected from millions of smart homes. The more data you analyze, the better suggestions you will be able to give. And this could even be used to suggest new smart home devices that would make their lifestyle easier. This solution helps people 'increase their understanding' of how to use their smart home and 'take advantage' of it - according to their needs).

### Summarized UI feedback from JG, Hanyu, Hathaitorn and Fani
#### JG: 
Quick scroll to a tab;
List should constantly show;
Red dot;
Order to sort tabs;
Cross reference tab data;
Threshold line;
Alert triangle logo;

#### Hanyu:
A little bit of everything;
Talk to the nurse to see what they want to see;
We assumed use-case;
Summary a list she has done;
Link to their personal info;
After dismiss --> alert the doctor;
Search move within patient list;
H.I.I.P.A. concern;
Dismiss for each tab rather than the patient;

#### Fani:
Yellow logo unsure;
What's in alerts?
Log out function;
Compress the chart (one week);

#### Mew:
Irregularities alert (have numbers over it)?;
Remove other unnecessary graphs;
Other colors;
What if other nurse attends the alert? --> Alert Log


### Summarized feedback from Crit Group 2
• Adding connection value/fun aspect to the elderly and their family? The calling-to-see-what-you're-cooking example (btw we can do this with a smart plug if we really want to, but not sure if it's worth it); 911 option could be possible; Having just the dashboard for now is okay, don't need to predict for them; They understand our connection in terms of linking the HMW to our Product Narrative

• Could potentially add more personal monitoring devices like iBeat

• A plethora of devices out there that provide helpful data in measuring activity and health status. The set up will be more beneficial in an independent/assisted/actual home

• Get beneficiaries such as insurnace companies to jump in on sponsoring our products; If we can prove to the insurance that knowing bed movement could be a significant thing, then insurance would be willing to pay

• Showcasing data is fine for prototyping, product can evolve afterwards

• Potentially get families in contact with what their old folks are doing within the Nursing Home

### Summarized feedback from Greg Pass

• Discussed about HMW --> Product Narrative

• Positive feedback on our narrative, our transition from our HMW to our Product Narrative

• One sentence for each category of the diagram ("Make me care...")

• Great that we're not pivoting

### Summarized feedback from Bill Lee (Sprint 2)

• UI has to be clear, which is what we have

• Whoever in duty has to easily be picked up by the UI

• In addition to standup and walk around, there are sensors in the marketplace that can have a more precise and clinical measurements. don’t limit ourselves to only their behavior and movements (e.g. toilet bowls that do urinalysis

• Overall, great start, very clean, very simple

### Summarized feedback from Tech Talk

• Product idea (what we're actually making and our idea) wasn't clear in the beginning

• The images on the powerpoint, like all our previous Sprint presentations, some parts of the image were invisible

• Hierarchy of diagram isn't clear; probably could be substituted by some images/icons


### Summarized feedback from Crit Group 3

• Get as soon as possible towards clarifying smart tech and elderly (no interaction); what kind of smart tech

• Get the concept over!! : unified dashboard that accesses data from Smart devices; narrative more important; actionable insights

• With the absence of this kind of tech, what happens?

• Patient care; three parties

• Don't add anything that isn't align with the story

• Frontend needs more development: call-to-actions

• "Alexa Silver"

• Horrible HMW, can edit away the word "Home"
